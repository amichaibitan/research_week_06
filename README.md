* we forked from the repository [fairpy](https://github.com/erelsgl/fairpy), and added two files:
* [two_players_fair_division.py](https://github.com/amichaibitan/research_week_06/blob/main/two_players_fair_division.py) - all the algorithms.
* [test_two_players_fair_division.py](https://github.com/amichaibitan/research_week_06/blob/main/test_two_players_fair_division.py) - pytests for the algorithms.
* test images:
